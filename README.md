# Heritability_SAS
SAS code to estimate heritability (possibly unbalanced designs) and its standard error from plant breeding experiments

EXAMPLE SAS PROGRAMS FOR ESTIMATING HERITABILITY AND ITS STANDARD ERROR
Example SAS codes correspond to J.B. Holland, W.E. Nyquist, and C.T. Cervantes-Martinez, "Estimating and Interpreting Heritability in Plant Breeding: An Update" (2003) Plant Breeding Reviews 22:9-164. 

Choose from three different examples for heritability estimation using REML:

1. [Heritability based on inbred lines evaluated in replicated, multi-environment trials](Heritability_replicated_inbred_lines.md). (Appendices 1 and 2 from the manuscript)


2. [Heritability estimation of two different populations simultaneously from a single experiment](Heritability_two_populations.md). (Appendix 3 from the manuscript)


3. [Heritability based on regression of F2:3 progeny means on individual F2 parents and based on variance among F2:3 families evaluated in an unbalanced, multi-environment trial](Heritability_F3progeny_F2parents.md). (Appendix 4 from the manuscript)
