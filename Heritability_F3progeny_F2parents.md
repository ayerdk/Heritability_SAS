 EXAMPLE SAS PROGRAM #2 FOR ESTIMATING HERITABILITY AND ITS STANDARD ERROR

Example SAS codes correspond to J.B. Holland, W.E. Nyquist, and C.T. Cervantes-Martinez, "Estimating and Interpreting Heritability in Plant Breeding: An Update" (2003) Plant Breeding Reviews.  

Heritability based on variance among random S0:1 families from two different populations evaluated in a common multi-environment trial, with missing data.  

 
Data are taken from Cervantes-Martinez et al. (2002) Crop Sci: In Press.

Briefly: yield was measured on 20 random S0:1 lines within five sets for each of two populations across four environments in Iowa.

To perform the analysis you first need to download the data files :
